# Reactive Java Backend with Spring Boot and MySQL (R2DBC)

## 📌 Introduction
This project is a **reactive backend** built using **Java**, **Spring Boot**, and **MySQL** with **R2DBC** for non-blocking database interactions. It provides full **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations** while following a **well-structured design pattern** to ensure clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

## 📂 Project Structure
The project follows a **layered architecture**:

```plaintext
📦 src/main/java/com/example
 ┣ 📂 entity          # Entity model (Database Representation)
 ┣ 📂 dto             # Data Transfer Objects
 ┣ 📂 repository      # Spring Data R2DBC Repository
 ┣ 📂 service
 ┃ ┣ 📄 Service.java  # Interface defining business logic
 ┃ ┗ 📄 ServiceImpl.java       # Implementation of business logic
 ┣ 📂 controller      # Handles API requests
 ┣ 📂 exception       # Global exception handling
 ┣ 📄 Application.java # Main Spring Boot Application

🔧 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Prerequisites

    Install Java 21
    Install Maven
    Install MySQL
    Install Postman (optional for testing APIs)

2️⃣ Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/https:/github.com/MendiOP/Reactive-Programming
cd your-repo-name

3️⃣ Configure Database

Update application.properties (or application.yml) with your MySQL connection details:

spring.r2dbc.url=r2dbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database
spring.r2dbc.username=root
spring.r2dbc.password=yourpassword
spring.sql.init.platform=mysql

4️⃣ Build & Run

mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run


## 📌 API Endpoints

| HTTP Method | Endpoint              | Description                |
|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| POST        | `/books`              | Create a new record        |
| GET         | `/books/id/{id}`      | Get a record by ID         |
| PUT         | `/books/update/{id}`  | Update a record by ID      |
| DELETE      | `/books/delete/{id}`  | Delete a record by ID      |
| GET         | `/books`              | Retrieve all records       |


**🛠 Usage**

**Create a New Record**

**POST /books**  
**Content-Type: application/json**

```json
{
  "name": "Kalbela",
  "author": "Sunil",
  "publisher": "Onno Prokash",
  "description": "An Uponnash"
}


Get a Record by ID

GET /books/id/1

Update a Record

PUT /books/update/1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "Kalbela",
  "author": "Sunil",
  "publisher": "Onno Prokash",
  "description": "An Uponnash"
}

Delete a Record

DELETE /books/delete/1

🔍 Troubleshooting

    Database Connection Issue?
    Ensure MySQL is running and the credentials in application.properties are correct.

    Maven Build Failing?
    Try running:

mvn clean install -U

Port Already in Use?
Change the default port in application.properties:

    server.port=8081
